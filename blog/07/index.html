    <h3 id="dissecting-the-role-of-programmed-cell-death-and-inflammation-in-sars-cov-2-infection-in-vivo">Dissecting the role of programmed cell death and inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo</h3>
<p>The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections and deaths worldwide. The diversity of COVID-19 disease in otherwise healthy people, from apparent asymptomatic infection to severe life-threatening disease associated with a dysregulated hyperinflammatory immune response, is perplexing. Programmed Cell Death drives inflammation via caspase-mediated processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, however the molecular mechanisms underlying these events during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed pre-clinical in vivo models using a naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variant that can infect mice and causes mild disease. Serially passaging of this virus in mice generated a mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain that causes weight loss, inflammation and lung pathology in adult mice and is deadly in aged animals, reflecting key aspects of severe COVID-19. These models allow a detailed gene-targeted approach to understand and systematically dissect the role of the main programmed cell death and inflammatory pathways and their key mediators in causing or mitigating both mild and severe SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Mice lacking the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β displayed improved disease outcomes and decreased viral burden. However, loss of lytic cell death by deletion of the effectors of pyroptosis (Gasdermin D/E/C/A), necroptosis (MLKL) or combined deficiency of GsdmD/MLKL had no effect on pathogenesis or viral burden, indicating that these types of cell death are not central to COVID-19 disease progression. Similarly, deletion of upstream initiators of pyroptosis (Caspases1/11/12) or necroptosis (RIPK3) or combined deficiency (Caspases1/11/12/RIPK3) caused no change to disease outcome in vivo. In recent years, it has become evident that Caspase-8 is central to the control of TNF-mediated apoptosis and necroptosis, and like caspase-1 also has the ability to induce pyroptosis and initiate cytokine processing. In our SARS-CoV-2 model, loss of Caspase-8 reduced disease, without impacting viral loads. Combined deficiency of the initiators of pyroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis (Caspase1/11/12/8/Ripk3-/-) caused significant amelioration of lung inflammation, overall disease pathology as well as viral burdens in mice, demonstrating the functional redundancy of the main cell death pathways in driving inflammation and viral dissemination during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of lung tissues elucidated that the response associated with severe and fatal outcomes was dominated by TNF signalling. Congruent with our pathway analysis, we showed that TNF deficient mice had mild disease compared to controls. Together, our data suggests TNF induces inflammation via NFkB and Caspase-8 to drive severe COVID-19 disease via the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (with functional back-up by Caspase-1).</p>
