      <description>A Simple Guide to Writing Your Abstract Step 1: Plan Consider what you want to present â€“ you might want to focus on a particular aim or aspect of your research, or present an overview of the whole project. It can help to discuss the focus of your abstract with your supervisor and/or peers before you start writing. The format is flexible, so donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t have much (or any) data to present.</description>

      <description>Pyroptosis inhibiting nanobodies block Gasdermin D pore formation Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a key mediator of pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death occurring downstream of inflammasome activation as part of the innate immune defence. Upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases, the N-terminal domain of GSDMD forms pores in the cell membrane resulting in cytokine release and eventually cell death. Targeting GSDMD is an attractive way to dampen inflammation. In this study, six GSDMD targeting nanobodies were characterized in terms of their binding affinity, stability, and effect on GSDMD pore formation.</description>
