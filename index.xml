      <description>Fluorescent reporter mice for p53 target genes to investigate p53-mediated tumour suppression The p53 gene is mutated in ~50% of human cancers and these mutations often contribute to poor responses to cancer therapy. The tumour suppressor p53 is a master regulator of several cellular processes, which together mediate the suppression of tumorigenesis. The p53 protein functions as a homo-tetrameric transcription factor, which directly transcriptionally regulates ~500 genes that suppress tumorigenesis, including the expression of p21, which is critical for the induction of cell cycle arrest/cell senescence, and Puma gene, which is a critical initiator of apoptotic cell death.</description>

      <description>Maternal SMCHD1 regulates Hox gene expression and patterning in the mouse embryo Structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1) is a non-canonical SMC protein that plays a key role in X chromosome inactivation and the epigenetic silencing of several clustered gene families, including the Hox clusters. Jansz et al., found that zygotic Smchd1-null mouse embryos displayed precocious activation of the Hox genes responsible for posterior vertebral patterning and consequential posterior-shift homeotic transformations in their skeletons.</description>

      <description>Genome wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens in vivo identify GATOR1 components as tumour suppressors in Eμ-MYC lymphoma development A fundamental goal in cancer research is identifying cancer driving genes and understanding how they promote tumourigenesis so we can develop novel therapeutics. While several tumour driving genes have been identified in targeted studies, deep sequencing data of primary tumours suggests that many more tumour promoting alterations exist.
We aimed to identify and characterise novel tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) through a functional genomic knockout screen using CRISPR/Cas9 in the Eµ-MYC mouse model.</description>

      <description>Interplay of type I and II interferons for the generation of CD8+ stem-like memory T cells Following viral infection, the timing of interferon (IFN) signalling is precisely regulated within lymphoid organs to engage anti-viral responses. While type I IFN (IFN-I) signalling is required for viral clearance, deficiency or inhibition of the IFN-I receptor, IFNAR, drives the generation of a highly proliferative memory CD8+ T cell subset termed stem-like memory T cells (TSL).</description>

      <description>Dissecting the role of programmed cell death and inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections and deaths worldwide. The diversity of COVID-19 disease in otherwise healthy people, from apparent asymptomatic infection to severe life-threatening disease associated with a dysregulated hyperinflammatory immune response, is perplexing. Programmed Cell Death drives inflammation via caspase-mediated processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, however the molecular mechanisms underlying these events during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood.</description>

      <description>Identifying gene fusions in single-cell RNA sequencing of cancers. Gene fusions are genomic structural rearrangements that result in a fusion between two different genes. They can occur in cancer and have been found to act as driver mutations that can lead to oncogenic effects. Currently, fusion finding from short-read bulk RNA-sequencing data is well established and numerous fusion finding programs such as Arriba, STAR-Fusion and JAFFA have been written. With the advancement of single-cell sequencing technologies, cancer can be analysed at a finer resolution, such as subclonal classification.</description>

      <description>Host, pathogen, and microbiome factors associated with Buruli ulcer disease severity Buruli Ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by the flesh-eating bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans resulting in subcutaneous necrotic skin infections. If not treated promptly, the disease could result in prolonged morbidity including disfiguring lesions requiring corrective surgery. According to the World Health Organisation, 33 countries have reported the disease, with 98% of reported cases corresponding to the African region. In Australia, outbreaks predominantly occur in Victoria.</description>

      <description>Pyroptosis inhibiting nanobodies block Gasdermin D pore formation Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a key mediator of pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death occurring downstream of inflammasome activation as part of the innate immune defence. Upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases, the N-terminal domain of GSDMD forms pores in the cell membrane resulting in cytokine release and eventually cell death. Targeting GSDMD is an attractive way to dampen inflammation. In this study, six GSDMD targeting nanobodies were characterized in terms of their binding affinity, stability, and effect on GSDMD pore formation.</description>

      <description>Assessing the improvement in accuracy of Plasmodium vivax serological exposure markers through use of different genetic sequences In most malaria-endemic countries, malaria elimination is largely hindered due to the absence of tools to identify individuals with hidden Plasmodium vivax liver-stage parasites, known as hypnozoites. Our lab has recently developed a panel of serological exposure markers that can identify P. vivax hypnozoite carriers for the first time. The accuracy of our serological exposure markers could be impacted if the circulating strains of P.</description>

      <description>Identifying novel vulnerabilities to sensitise Lkb1-mutant lung adenocarcinoma to T cell mediated killing KRAS is the most frequently altered oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Recently, the clinical development of targeted therapies has improved the treatment of a subset of patients, however the heterogeneity of KRAS mutant LUAD remains a clinical challenge. Identifying tumour intrinsic dependencies through common co-occurring mutations are sought to more effectively target KRAS-mutant LUAD. Loss-of-function mutations found in STK11/Lkb1, are frequently found co-mutated with KRAS, and comprise an aggressive form of the disease, with resistance to chemotherapy.</description>

      <description>Neutrophil heterogeneity and autoantibody-mediated NETosis in COVID-19 severity risk COVID-19 causes a variety of symptoms from asymptomatic, through to mild, moderate or severe. Accumulating evidence shows neutrophil heterogeneity and the generation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) as a hallmark in COVID-19 disease severity. Autoinflammatory diseases in which NETs are associated with inflammatory pathology suggest a role for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in disease exacerbation. Although different neutrophil subpopulations vary in capability to generate NETs, how this relates to their interaction with autoantibodies and whether this contributes to COVID-19 severity remains unexplored.</description>

      <description>Molecular signatures of drug sensitivity in ovarian carcinoma cell lines Ovarian carcinoma has the 6th highest mortality rate of any cancer in women. The poor prognosis can be largely attributed to the lack of targeted treatment. Standard treatment for all patients, is debulking surgery followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. While initial responses to this regime are hopeful, 75% of patients will experience recurrence within 3 years, and only 20% will become long term survivors.</description>

      <description>3D whole organ imaging of lung and brain vasculature to characterise the cellular features of breast cancer metastases Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women, and the risk of death from metastatic (stage 4) disease remains high. In recent years, chemotherapy and mastectomy have improved the overall survival of breast cancer patients and reduced the incidence of breast cancer in at-risk individuals. However, these treatments are non-specific, and do not eliminate the risk of cancer development, patient relapse, or progression to advanced metastatic disease.</description>

      <description>Variations in antigen binding domains of logic gating circuits has significant impact on functionality Glioblastoma is an aggressive and malignant brain tumour and five-year survival rates are estimated at only 5%. Consequently, new, targeted treatments are required to enhance patient survival. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells have revolutionized the treatment of many types of haematological malignancies; providing a patient’s immune cells with a cancer target-specific synthetic receptor which mediates recognition and elimination of malignant cells.</description>

      <description>Evaluating selection of representative pre-clinical models for patient tumours using transcriptional profiles. Relating insights from pre-clinical studies to individual patient tumour samples relies on the selection of the most relevant pre-clinical models. Analysis of transcriptional profiles is a promising approach for identifying the best pre-clinical models for primary tumours, however benchmarking of existing methods has been limited. To address this, we have developed a benchmarking strategy that relies on the assessment of sample similarity both within and across model types to test a wide variety of standard and bespoke methods.</description>

      <description>Immunity to malaria: association between antibodies and clinical protection in Plasmodium vivax low-endemic areas Malaria is one of the top ten causes of death in low-income countries. Immunity to Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria, is difficult to achieve. A single infection with P. vivax does not confer long-lasting protection, and multiple exposures are required to develop immunity. Furthermore, naturally acquired immunity only offers protection against symptomatic disease, leaving the individual susceptible to asymptomatic infection.</description>

      <description>CRISPR activation screens identify co-drivers of malignant haematopoiesis in a DNMT3a mutant background Genome-wide sequencing studies have shown that the genetic basis of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is highly complex. Mutations in de novo methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) are overrepresented in patients with AML. However, DNMT3a mutations alone are not sufficient to cause malignancies. Therefore, I aim to identify co-drivers of malignancies in a mutant DNMT3a background. This project utilises a mouse model which has the most frequently found DNMT3a mutation in human AML, in the endogenous mouse DNMT3a locus.</description>

      <description>Using immuno-genomics to understand responses to combination DNA-repair inhibitor and immunotherapy treatments in high-grade serous ovarian cancer Current first-line treatments for high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) combine cytoreductive surgery with platinum-taxane-based chemotherapy, to which 85% of patients show an initial response. However, only 30% of women will remain in remission, with the remainder relapsing within 4-16 months with progressively more chemo-resistant disease, underlying the need for more curative therapeutic regimens.</description>

      <description>Single Cell Scoring of Molecular Phenotypes Molecular biology indicates that, just like fingerprints, every individual has a unique DNA sequence, and each cell of the individual has identical genetic material. However, the different molecular phenotypes in our body arise due to variable gene expression. Depending on their spatial and temporal states, different cells express distinct genes or groups of genes (gene sets) and supress others to achieve the desired function. We can now quantify the gene expression of a single cell, that can be used to identify its phenotype and thereby define the cell’s state.</description>

      <description>High fat diets rapidly alter gut homeostasis Westernized diet, featured by higher intake of saturated fats and lower consumption of fibres, represents a chief environmental factor of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In mice, prolonged high fat diets (HFD) induce low-grade chronic intestinal inflammation characterized by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in the intestine and lead to increased intestinal permeability. Although the symptoms and inflammation induced by long-term HFD during obesity and diabetes have been well characterized, the early functional changes that occur in response to diet changes that precede the establishment of chronic intestinal inflammation remain unclear.</description>

      <description>Identifying novel treatment options for ovarian carcinosarcoma Ovarian carcinosarcoma (OCS) is a rare and aggressive subtype of ovarian cancer characterised by both epithelial carcinomatous and mesenchymal sarcomatous components1. The conversion theory of OCS posits that this biphasic nature arises via a sarcomatous transformation of carcinomatous cells. As these cells display elevated expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) when compared to epithelial ovarian cancers, EMT was identified as a potential driver of this sarcomatous transformation1,2.</description>

      <description>Determining the impact of antigen dose and affinity on B cell antibody isotype switching Background: Once activated, B cells can switch the type of antibody they produce through a process known as class switch recombination (CSR), allowing for more effective antibody responses tailored to the type of infection encountered. This process requires expression of both activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and germline RNA transcripts (GLTs). Previous work by Horton et al established a model capable of accurately describing rates of CSR in cells stimulated with cytokine, based on patterns of AID and GLT expression.</description>

      <description>Characterising the role of a Huwe1 enhancer regulated by p53 in Eμ-Myc lymphoma suppression using CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas12a technology The deregulation of c-Myc accounts for the development of 70% of human cancers including malignant B cell lymphomas. The Eμ-Myc transgenic mouse model is designed to mimic Burkitt’s lymphoma (an aggressive B cell lymphoma subtype) by translocating the c-Myc gene so that it is under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) chain enhancer Eμ, which causes c-Myc overexpression in early B lymphoid cells and eventually tumour formation.</description>

      <description>Small-molecule modulation of BAK- and BAX-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis Mitochondrial or intrinsic apoptosis is a regulated cell death modality that is crucial for not only normal embryonic development, but also tissue homeostasis of multi-cellular organisms. B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family proteins play an important role in regulating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. BCL-2 family members are grouped into 3 categories. One category comprises anti-apoptotic proteins, which inhibit apoptosis (BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, MCL-1 and BFL-1/A1) while another consists of the effector proteins BAX and BAK, which promote apoptosis.</description>

      <description>EVALUATING THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF TBK1 INHIBITION IN CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED RHEUMATIC ADVERSE EVENTS INTRODUCTION
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a highly efficacious class of cancer immunotherapy but have been associated with the development of autoimmune-like rheumatic adverse events (RAEs). RAEs are currently treated with broadly immunosuppressive corticosteroids but these may compromise the anti-tumour effect of ICIs. Thus, new therapies that can resolve RAEs without negating the benefit of ICIs are urgently needed.</description>

      <description>Benchmarking long-read RNA-sequencing analysis tools using in silico mixtures The growing popularity of long-read sequencing technology in transcriptomic studies has led to the development of customised algorithms for isoform identification and workflows for differential expression analysis. However, the current lack of benchmark datasets with inbuilt ground-truth makes it challenging to compare the performance of the different methods available. Here, we present a benchmark experiment using two human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that were each profiled in triplicate together with synthetic, spliced, spike-in RNAs (“sequins”).</description>

      <description>Leveraging a novel combinational therapy as a treatment for lupus Current treatments for the chronic autoimmune disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (lupus) are either non-specific or do not control inflammation, meaning that refractory disease often occurs. In lupus, the production and deposition of autoantibodies triggers inflammation in organs such as the kidneys and skin. Therapeutic strategies which target both pathogenic plasma cells and inflammation are required to not only control lupus symptoms but to inhibit disease progression.</description>

      <description>Characterisation of PROTAC-induced branched ubiquitination for targeted protein degradation Ubiquitination is a critical component of post-translational modifications that regulate cellular protein functions and turnover. The sequential cascade is mediated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) to conjugate the small 8.6 kDa protein, ubiquitin, to a lysine residue on a substrate protein. The attachment of ubiquitin to an internal lysine of another ubiquitin molecule produces polyubiquitin chains, with 8 possible homotypic linkage types that can be generated to produce distinct cellular signals.</description>

      <description>Evaluating the effect of transmembrane domain oligomerisation on the safety and efficacy of CAR T cell therapies Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a new treatment for cancer patients with six CAR T cell products having been approved by the FDA since late 2017. CAR T cells are produced by modifying patient T cells with engineered receptors (CARs) that bind specifically to target cancer antigens. Once the extracellular antigen-binding domain of a CAR binds to a cancer antigen, the receptors activate T cell effector functions, including secretion of granzymes and perforin that induce apoptosis of surrounding tumour cells.</description>

      <description>Characterising the consequences of heterozygous CASP3 loss in colorectal cancer Caspase-3 is a cysteine protease predominately known for its role in apoptosis. Emerging evidence is highlighting alternative roles of caspase-3 in processes such as cell cycle, differentiation and migration. Genome sequencing projects have revealed the genomic landscape of human colorectal cancer (CRC) and identified recurrent heterozygous CASP3 deletions in ~10% of patients with non-hypermutated CRC. However, the contribution of CASP3 loss to CRC development or progression is unclear.</description>

      <description>Mitochondrial quality control activation during gram-negative bacterial infection Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by the death of dopamine-producing neurons (DA neurons) within the substantia nigra. It has become clear that mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor in PD pathogenesis. Agents which harm mitochondria, including bacterial pathogens, contribute to PD progression. PINK1/Parkin mitophagy and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) are two major pathways that function to maintain mitochondrial health.</description>

      <description>Understanding the regulation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein PUMA to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment Background: Apoptosis is a genetically programmed process of cell death that is dysregulated in diverse cancers. The BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) protein family regulates the mitochondrial- mediated process of apoptosis, and it contains both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic family members. BH3 (Bcl-2 homolog region [BH] 3)-only proteins (e.g. BIM, PUMA, NOXA) are pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 protein family that initiate the process of apoptosis, and play crucial roles in the killing of malignant cells by diverse anti-cancer agents.</description>

      <description>Combination drug development for metastatic colorectal cancer treatment Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite of the range of chemo- and targeted therapies development, drug resistance remains a key limiting factor in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treatment. Discovery of new drug combinations through drug repurposing screens offers an opportunity to overcome treatment failure. We performed high- throughput drug combination screening of 919 known drugs with three main chemotherapy backbones (5-FU, SN-38 and oxaliplatin) in 11 human CRC cell lines.</description>

      <description>Nanobodies targeting malaria transmission-blocking candidate Malaria parasites develop both in humans and the Anopheles mosquito. Malaria parasite transmission occurs when an infected female Anopheles mosquito injects malaria parasites into a human host. Within mosquito, the sexual stages of the malaria parasites, which are called gametocytes, undergo sexual reproduction and several developmental stages to finally produce sporozoites that migrate to the mosquito’s salivary glands, ready to infect humans. Parasite numbers are very low in the mosquito stages, representing a promising opportunity for intervention whereby malaria transmission can be blocked by inhibiting the function of essential sexual stage antigens.</description>

      <description>How do dopaminergic neurons die in Parkinson’s disease? Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease, with the current, 10 million patients, predicted to double by 2040. PD develops over decades and is characterised by a progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to motor dysfunction. Current therapies for PD offer symptomatic relief, however no disease-modifying therapies exist that stop or slow the progression of the disease.</description>

      <description>A novel inhibitor of the deubiquitinase USP9x The ubiquitin-proteasome system is critical for the regulation of cellular homeostasis. Through a cascade of sequential enzymatic reactions, the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin is conjugated to substrate proteins. Conjugation of ubiquitin serves as a post-translational signal modulating a multitude of cellular processes and protein fates, most importantly marking substrate proteins for degradation by the proteasome. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) revert ubiquitin signals by removing ubiquitin from substrate proteins, stabilizing their substrate, and contributing to maintaining a pool of free ubiquitin in the cell.</description>

      <description>Investigating enhancer regulation of lineage specification in the mammary gland Transcriptional regulation governs lineage differentiation in all tissues including the mammary gland, yet our understanding of this regulatory system remains limited. Enhancer regulation of transcriptional programs are emerging as critical to the differentiation process and cancer. Transcription factors also coordinate lineage specificity and mutations in transcription factor networks are associated with cancer. Lineage specification is important in breast cancer development because breast cancer sub types arise from cells along different stages of the differentiation hierarchy.</description>
